          <br />
          The Albanian pavilion becomes a testing area where all people can
          participate. We can see it as a boost to open up a dialog about the
          meaning of public space and as a reaction towards increasing
          privatization of public spaces in Albania and around the globe.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the gesture of »breaking the wall« we want to open up and expand
          the space of the Albanian pavilion into the city. With this gesture we
          want to show to the wider public that we should always question the
          borders and try to look beyond, that we can always push the boundaries
          and improve the public space in the cities.
